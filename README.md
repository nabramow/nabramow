## Hi there 👋

I’m Nicole — a Senior Full Stack Software Engineer working primarily in TypeScript/JavaScript (React, Node).

I care a lot about **building things that matter**, not just shipping features for the sake of infinite growth. I’m ambitious, value work–life balance, and I’m very good at turning fuzzy ideas into executed plans.

Big believer in:
- 👩‍💻 Remote work that actually works  
- 🧠 EQ as a real engineering skill  
- 🤝 Diverse perspectives in tech → better systems  
- 🕊️ Tech that makes the world better, not louder  

London-based. US/EU (German) dual citizen, UK Global Talent visa holder.

🔭 Core leadership team + core contributor at [@Couchers-org](https://github.com/Couchers-org/couchers), a nonprofit hospitality exchange platform focused on community and cultural exchange. I help set direction, ship features, and keep things moving. Currently finishing the mobile app.

❤️ I work only with companies that aren’t making the world worse—environmentally, politically, or socially. Bonus points if they actively make it better 😉.

⚡ Fun fact: I worked on a ship in Antarctica and once ended up in a Febreze commercial.

Risk tolerance: high. Judgment: mostly sound.
