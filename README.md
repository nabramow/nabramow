## Hi there 👋

I’m Nicole — a Senior Full Stack Software Engineer working primarily in TypeScript/JavaScript (React, Node).

I care a lot about **building things that matter**, not just shipping features for the sake of infinite growth. I’m ambitious, value work–life balance, and I’m very good at turning fuzzy ideas into executed plans.

Big believer in:
- 👩‍💻 Remote work that actually works  
- 🧠 EQ as a real engineering skill  
- 🤝 Diverse perspectives in tech → better systems  
- 🕊️ Tech that makes the world better, not louder  

I’m a US/EU (German) dual citizen and UK Global Talent visa holder. I am based in London with international experience across Germany and the US.

🔭 I’m on the core leadership team at **@Couchers-org**, a nonprofit hospitality exchange platform focused on community and cultural exchange. I help set strategy, unblock teams, and make sure things actually get done.  
Right now I’m wrapping up Couchers’ mobile app using **React Native + Expo**.

🌱 Currently improving my Python skills so I can contribute more deeply to Couchers’ backend (and because I’m impatient).

❤️ I try to work only with companies that aren’t making the world worse environmentally, politically, or socially. Bonus points if they’re actively making it better 😉.

⚡ Fun fact: I once worked on a ship in Antarctica (the only person onboard who'd ever had an office job) and accidentally ended up in a Febreze commercial after agreeing to be blindfolded and put into a van by strangers.  
Risk tolerance: high. Judgment: mostly sound.
